# MC_requests

Monte Carlo requests for charm physics analyses

This repository contains setup to prepare and test locally the MC requests for charm analyses at 7, 5 and 0.9 TeV. 

The setup has been modified for this purpose and the codes (CmsDriv.py and CmsRun.sh) were created to make the local test easier. It is based on the template from B-Physics group [1].
